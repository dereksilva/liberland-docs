### Choosing personal or company account
Any person, wallet address of account can create a company in on the Liberland blockchain, however to be officially registered within the nation
of Liberland it needs to satisfy some minimal requirements.

The first decision is choosing if you want to open a company under your own personal account or create a new company account.

We recommend creating a new company account (wallet address) and doing the process with the company account to keep finances and eventual
contract obligations separate from you personally. However, depending on the nature of the business you might want to choose to open it under
your personal account, especially if you are the only physical person in the company.

It is easy to switch between many accounts at [blockchain.liberland.org](blockchain.liberland.org) in the menu wallet selector.

Whichever account you choose, update your identity, especially display name and contact info in the profile page.
If you do, this will make it easy for people to send tokens to your address by searching for your display name using the wallet at [blockchain.liberland.org](www.blockchain.liberland.org/home/wallet)

### Create company
To create a company, in [blockchain.liberland.org](blockchain.liberland.org) choose registries on the menu and select My companies -> Register company

This will open up a form you can fill out to request company registration.
Not all fields are mandatory, so feel free to leave some blank if it doesnt apply.


Regarding 'Editable by registrar' field, its best to enable it. This means the Liberland company registrar can make changes to your company data
in case your account is lost, or you are found guilty of breaking the law. Most registrars will not register companies without this field checked.

Sign the transaction and your company request for registration is ready! It should take about a day for the request to be approved.

After it is approved you can get your certificate of incorporation by clicking the button 

TODO GENERATING CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

Your company will also appear in the 
[list of Liberland companies](www.blockchain.liberland.org/home/registries/allCompanies)

### Create contracts (optional)
Your company might operate under a legally binding contract, or you might want to sign contracts with clients or other parties.
You can reference these contracts directly in your company registration if you so wish.

Note that contracts might require legal expertise to set it up properly. 
Feel free to ask for help, there should be companies and professionals offering these services.

We are working on a easy to use contract builder but it will take time to finish.

### Handling payments

While Liberland does not have any regulations on methods, currencies, or reporting of payments, 
it is good for Liberland to do business on the Liberland chain, especially if you are engaging in legally binding contracts.

Assets that are currently available on Liberland blockchain are LLM, LLD and stablecoins like LLEUR and USDT.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are welcome, but they are of course on their own chains and not on Liberland blockchain.
However, 'wrapped' versions are available through 'bridges', and you can do business in 'bitcoin stablecoins' on Liberland blockchain.

LLD is the easiest, as it can be exchanged to USDT, BTC, other crypto or fiat like USD and EUR.
This means that you can do business with LLD internationally, or with any other crypto. 

If you so wish, you can issue an invoice to the client in USD, convert it into LLD, pay for services of another company with the LLD,
or convert it into Bitcoin for long term investment, or of course, any other combination. 
We are not here to tell you what to do with your money, we are just here to support you if you need help figuring out how to do it.

### Fundraising, assets and the stock market

You can issue stock of your company and list it for sale on the Liberland DEX stock market for fundraising, or any other purposes.

There are no regulations in Liberland how to do it, but if you want to do it on chain, the proper way is to do it through an on-chain asset.

This will cost 200 LLD.

Once your asset has been created, its good practice to connect it to an shareholder contract. 
As usual, there are no regulations about it in Liberland, but 
this contract should give people the incentive to buy the stake in your company, like percentage of profits or voting rights 
what is common with company stock worldwide.

An example of a shareholder contract can be found here

You can now list it on the Liberland DEX stock market where you can set the price and people can buy and trade it

Do note however, that if you are listing a subsidiary of a company also active in another country, there may be regulations about doing this
in the other country. USA for example regulates trading securities, so make sure to follow local laws if you plan to resell stock in other countries.


### Subsidiary / Branch of company in other country
In Liberland you can open a subsidiary of a company primarily based in another country.

The main reason to do this is to do business in Liberland and its ecosystem and legally spend the money in the other country
if you wish to follow the laws of the local country.

Follow the normal steps of opening a company but make sure to note in your registration that the main company is the primary owner and 
include this information in any contracts you create as a company.

Any money earned in Liberland as this company that you want to spend in your other country 
should be converted into LLD or other widely tradeable currencies, exchanged for fiat on the exchange and paid out to your main company bank account.
Normally, only this last fiat transaction needs to be reported in the other country.

Note that regulations vary from country to country so make sure to follow the local law, but this process should be sufficient for small 
businesses in USA and EU.
