# Account migration

It is possible to migrate your identity, voting rights and staked merits from one account to the other.
Only your identity, voting rights and staked merits are able to be migrated. Other tokens such as LLD or liquid merits
can only be migrated if you have access to both accounts and you send them yourself.
The reason for the migration feature is that your onchain identity provides a critical feature of a nation state, 
therefore it should be recoverable in case of account loss. Other tokens behave as any other blockchain, and are 
permanently lost if the account is lost.

To migrate your account
 - Triple check if you have saved your recovery phrase, and recover the old account with the phrase if possible
 - Setup a new account
 - Remove the identity from your old account [here](https://blockchain.liberland.org/home/profile)
 - Set the identity on your new account to be the same as your previous one here [here](https://blockchain.liberland.org/home/profile)
 - Send yourself any tokens and assets from your old account to your new one
 - Submit a request to the court by sending an email to justice@liberland.org to transfer the identity and staked merits.
   - The court might request additional steps like confirming your physical identity via a passport or other ways
   - In case of account loss, skip the steps done by the old account. However, only your staked LLM will be recovered.
