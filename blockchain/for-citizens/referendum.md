# How to Vote in a Referendum

## Overview

In Liberland, referendums are the primary method for enacting decisions or legislation. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the referendum system in Liberland, including the types of referendums, eligibility requirements, voting process, and proposal guidelines.

## The Referendum System in Liberland

### Legal Framework

Liberland's referendums are based on the draft Constitution and Referendum Law. These documents, though currently drafts, will gain legal force upon adoption in a future referendum. They are already used to build essential infrastructure, such as the Liberland Blockchain.

## Types of Referendums

### Meritocratic Referendum (Positive Referendum)

#### Purpose

A Positive Referendum is used to adopt, reject, or modify any law, regulation, or government decision.

#### Eligibility

- All Citizens with at least 5000 politically pooled Liberland Merits (LLM) are eligible to participate.

#### Voting Process

1\. **Citizen Onboarding**: Ensure you are an onboarded Citizen.

2\. **Access Voting Platform**: Visit [blockchain.liberland.org](http://blockchain.liberland.org).

3\. **Navigate to Voting**: Go to the Voting/Referenda section.

4\. **Select Referendum**: Choose the referendum you wish to vote on.

5\. **Cast Vote**: Vote AYE (yes) or NAY (no).

6\. **Ignore Voting Weight Prompt**: The system will prompt about voting weight, which can be ignored.

7\. **Vote Update**: If you change your mind, you can update your vote for the cost of a transaction (a few cents).

#### Duration

- Each referendum lasts for 7 days.

- After voting concludes, there is an additional 7-day period to prepare for enactment.

#### Vote Counting

- Votes are tallied based on politically pooled LLM, not headcount.

- Unpooling LLM takes time, indicating a commitment to Liberland.

#### Proposing a Meritocratic Referendum

- Any Citizen can propose a referendum.

- Higher acceptance thresholds are applied to prevent ad hoc populist measures.

- For a smoother process, it is recommended to ask a Member of Congress to propose on your behalf.

### Democratic Veto (Negative Referendum)

#### Purpose

A Democratic Veto is used to remove legislative measures or officials from office, demonstrating a "headcount" democracy with free and equal elections.

#### Types of Democratic Veto

- **Public Veto**: Removes any legislative measure (laws, regulations, etc.) enacted by the Government.

- **Dismissal**: Removes any official or agent (employee) from office.

#### Voting Process

1\. **Access Voting Platform**: Visit [blockchain.liberland.org](http://blockchain.liberland.org).

2\. **Navigate to Legislation**: Choose a type (e.g., Law, International Treaty) from the top menu.

3\. **Show Section**: Find the section you wish to veto.

4\. **Cast Veto**: Click "Cast Veto".

#### Vote Counting

- The referendum remains active indefinitely.

- The AYE (repeal, dismiss) side wins only when 50 percent plus one voter (not LLM) votes for it.

- Until the threshold is reached, the referendum remains in force.
