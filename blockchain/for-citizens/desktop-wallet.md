# Using desktop wallet with Liberland Blockchain

Talisman Wallet supports Liberland Blockchain on launch, and we support using [Talisman Wallet](https://www.talisman.xyz/) for interacting with Liberland Blockchain and dApps. This guide will walk you through setting up the Talisman browser extension for Chrome and Chromium-based browsers (Opera, Arc, Brave, Edge, etc.).

## Install Talisman browser extension

[Install Talisman](https://www.talisman.xyz/download)

## Add account

Either create a new account or import an existing one.

If you're creating a new account, be sure to save the passphrase/private key in a secure location.

If you're importing an existing account for use on Liberland Blockchain, it must be an existing Polkadot account. 

## Use Liberland Wallet dApp

To open the dApp, visit [blockchain.liberland.org](https://blockchain.liberland.org) in the same browser where you installed Talisman.

Now that you have a wallet, if you are a citizen or e-resident, you can begin [onboarding](https://liberland-1.gitbook.io/wiki/v/public-documents/blockchain/for-citizens/onboarding#id-3-getting-merits-and-residency). If you're using a desktop computer, adapt the instructions to use Talisman, Polkadotjs, or Subwallet browser extension instead of Subwallet's mobile app.
