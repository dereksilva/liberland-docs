## Voting for congress

You can vote for congress at [https://blockchain.liberland.org/home/voting/congressional-assemble](https://blockchain.liberland.org/home/voting/congressional-assemble).

Voting happens on Liberland blockchain every 90 days. Only citizens not on welfare can vote, and they vote with their staked merits.

If you havent already, [start using the LL blockchain](onboarding.md), just go to [blockchain.liberland.org](https://blockchain.liberland.org/liberland-login) and follow the steps.

Congress is supposed to pass budgets and laws, but during the transitionary period it shares this responsibility with the provisional government.

When voting, select all candidates you wish to see elected. The algorithm will try to get as many of your candidates in congress as possible.
For example, if you vote for 3 candidates, but taking into account other peoples votes 2 of those are guaranteed to be elected, your voting power
will go to the last candidate, needing just that little bit extra votes to get him over the election threshold.

This way, you can select everyone you want to be in congress, while also making sure your votes arent wasted.

You should order your candidates by preference, as preference voting is used when electing a Speaker of Congress.
Preference voting does not matter for electing candidates into congress, it only matters for picking Speaker of Congress from elected congressmen.

It is the same system used by polkadot, you can [learn more about the algorithm, called Weighted Phragmen that is used in Liberland elections here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-phragmen#understanding-phragm%C3%A9n).

Congress passes budgets with senate oversight, senate having the power to veto any spending.

Congress passes legislation with democratic oversight, any new legislation needs to be confirmed by the citizens via a public referendum.
While anyone can create referenda, congress created referenda are 'privileged' in the sense that they 'pass by default' - citizens need to vote no to block it,
while normal referenda 'fail by default' - citizens need to vote yes to pass it.

This is the same system used by polkadot, [you can learn more about biased referenda here](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn/learn-governance#public-referenda).

You can also delegate your voting power to a person in congress using the delegate button.
