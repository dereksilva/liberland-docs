# Congress

Here you will find all the necessary information about the Liberland Congress. [Learn more about our congress](https://liberland-1.gitbook.io/wiki/v/public-documents/primers/congress).

Congressmen have some passive options. One such possibility is for citizens to receive their delegated votes.

## Congress view

Below is a screenshot showing the [congress of Liberland](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.liberland.org#/council). It is widely available and everyone can display the number of congressmen and candidates. But only citizen's submit candidacy.

### Voting for Congressman

Every citizen can vote to elect a congressman. Voting for congressmen takes place on [Phragmen's voting rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phragmen%27s_voting_rules). This means that a citizen can vote for many candidates, but the power of a vote is smaller with each subsequent candidate. So the first vote has the highest weight

1. Visit [Polkadot.js Apps](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.liberland.org#/council)
2. Click "Vote"
3. Select a candidate from the list and then click on the "Vote" button

In the voting panel, you can choose many candidates for whom you want to vote. The order of votes in the panel also matters - the higher the person is, the more important the vote they will receive.

After applying, other citizens can vote for you and other candidates.

### Congressmen's actions

Congressmen can submit proposals under the ["Motions" tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.liberland.org#/council/motions). Then these can be considered by the whole Congress.

If you do not know what proposals you can make, find out more at "How to submit proposals"

#### How to vote for a proposal

All pending proposals are displayed in the ["Motions" tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.liberland.org#/council/motions). Proposals are displayed as a list and any congressman can vote on them.

As you can see, next to the motion there is a vote button. It opens the voting panel. Then on the panel, you can vote for or against the proposal

<br />

#### How to submit proposals

To vote, you need to set the correct threshold and proposal. Different actions may require different minimum thresholds. Threshold is the minimum percentage of votes that a proposal must receive in order to be approved. The threshold is automatically set to 50% but some methods may require setting a different threshold value. To find out which proposals should have what value, go to the "Threshold"

1. Open the ["Motions" tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.liberland.org#/council/motions)
2. Click the "Propose motion" button
3. Fill in the information about the proposal and then click the "Propose" button

### Liberland legislation

Congressmen are able to add and remove legislation at the international treaty tier. The international treaty tier is represented as "tier=1". Learn more about these methods in `Thresholds`.

- Constitution: This tier encompasses the rights outlined in the constitution. Any citizen can propose changes to this law.
- International Treaties: These treaties fall under the jurisdiction of the congress. Modifications to these treaties can be made through "motions" initiated by the congress.
- Law: This tier comprises legislation. Any citizen has the opportunity to submit their own proposals (referendums).

Other laws can be modified by creating proposals (referendums).

### Democracy external

Congress can create external proposals that differ from the usual proposal in priority. External proposals, thanks to their priority, have the priority of displaying. Below are steps presenting the addition of such a proposal. Read more about the proposals in 'Thresholds'

1. Create [preimages in this tab](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.liberland.org#/preimages) using "Add preimage" button.
   <br />
   <img height="300px" src="congress-assets/preimages.png"/>
   <br />
2. Copy preimage hash
   <br />
   <img height="300px" src="congress-assets/preimage-hash.png"/>
   <br />
3. Paste hash into proposal
   <br />

### Thresholds

What are thresholds. This is a number or percentage of votes representing the number of congressmen who must vote for a proposal created in order for it to be accepted.

The screenshots presented below contain a description of the fields that will allow us to better understand the table.

Different actions in Congress require different votes to approve the vote. Below is a table of possible actions with minimum threshold values.

Validators are the ones who verify and approve transactions on the network. The process of selecting these validators is similar to a contest. Different participants propose their own solutions, and the one who offers the best solution is chosen as the winner. This function allows to determine the level of credibility that a validator must achieve in order for its result to be recognized. Setting the value to `None` removes the limit.
