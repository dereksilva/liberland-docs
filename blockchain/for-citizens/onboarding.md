# Onboarding

This guide is written with SubWallet's mobile app in mind. If you are using another wallet on mobile (e.g., Talisman) or are a web/computer user (using e.g., polkadot{.js}), you can easily adapt the instructions accordingly to the wallet/platform you are using.

## Quick guide

1. Make sure you are an E-Resident/citizen with correct number of merits on [the main website](https://liberland.org).
2. [Install SubWallet](https://www.subwallet.app/download.html), create a wallet, and save the passphrase on paper.
3. Associate the wallet address with [your Liberland profile](https://liberland.org/profile).
4. Go to the Liberland Blockchain at [blockchain.liberland.org in Subwallet](https://mobile.subwallet.app/browser?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblockchain.liberland.org%2Fliberland-login).<br /><br />![](../media/subwallet/subwallet_browser_menu.png)<br />![](../media/subwallet/subwallet_search_bar.jpg)
5. Click on **Profile**, claim onboarding LLD, and update identity.

You will then get your merits transferred to your blockchain wallet in about one business day.

## Step-by-step guide
Setting up your identity on the Liberland Blockchain requires roughly 3 minutes and consists of a few steps:
1. Setting up a wallet
2. Securing your keys
3. Getting merits and residency on the website
4. Associating the wallet address with your profile
5. Claiming merits and E-Residency/citizenship on chain

### 1. Set up a wallet
A wallet address is your public address on the blockchain. It comes with a seed phrase&mdash;12 words that are the keys to your on-chain existence.

Use SubWallet, polkadot{.js}, or Talisman as your wallet software based on your platform:

[Mobile wallet setup](mobile-wallet.md)

[Web wallet setup](desktop-wallet.md)

### 2.  Secure keys
During wallet setup, you got a 12-word mnemonic seed phrase. Store it somewhere where it will not be lost nor found by someone else.

{% hint style="warning" %}
It is ***very important*** not to lose that phrase or share it with anyone, as it is the only key or "password" to your on-chain existence.
{% endhint %}

A common, low-tech solution is to write it on a piece of paper and put it in a safe, or to use a password manager. Taking a photo of it on your phone or the like is *not recommended* because it is mostly likely not encrypted and someone else might see it.

### 3. Get merits and E-Residency/citizenship
1. Go to [the Dashboard](https://liberland.org/dashboard) of the main website.
2. Make sure your merits and E-Residency/citizenship status are accurate in the Dashboard. It should look something like this:<br />![](../media/profile-status-merits-info.png)
3. If you do not see accurate values, contact whomever promised you merits or E-Residency/citizenship status to resolve the inaccuracy.

### 4. Associate wallet address with your profile

Now it's time to associate your wallet address with your profile like so:

1. Click on [**Edit profile**](https://liberland.org/profile) on the Dashboard of the main website.
2. Copy your wallet address from the wallet software:
   1. Click **Address**.<br />![](../media/subwallet/address-button.png)
   2. Type in **LLD**, and click the token.<br />![](../media/subwallet/show-address-token-search-selection.png)
   3. Click the **Copy address** button.<br />![](../media/subwallet/copy-address.png)
4. Scroll down to the **Blockchain information** section and paste your wallet address in this field.<br />![](../media/blockchain-address.png)
5. Click **Save changes**.

At this point, you should have your public wallet address generated, your 12-word mnemonic phrase safely stored, and your Liberland profile updated with the correct number of merits and E-Residency/citizenship status and your wallet address associated on the website.

### 5. Claim merits and status on chain

If on the web, do the next steps using the browser you have SubWallet, polkadot{.js}, or Talisman installed on (e.g. Chrome, Firefox, etc.).

If on a mobile device, *you must use the SubWallet app's built-in browser located in bottom menu in the app.* The button says **dApps**.

![](../media/subwallet/subwallet_browser_menu.png)

1. Navigate to [https://blockchain.liberland.org](https://blockchain.liberland.org) and log in.<br />![](../media/subwallet/subwallet_search_bar.jpg)
2. It's time to claim your tokens and E-Resident/citizen identity! Open the menu and click on the **Profile** button.

{% hint style="info" %}
Since all actions on-chain cost a small amount of gas fees and you are already an E-Resident, you are eligible for a small amount of LLD to get you started.
{% endhint %}

3. First, click the **Claim complimentary LLD** button. After a few seconds, it should tell you to refresh the page and you should have LLD&nbsp;2 so that you can begin using the blockchain right away.
4. Click **Update identity**, and set it to what you want your on-chain identity to be.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** There is no requirement to use your real name, but make sure to include your correct citizenship/E-Residency status.
{% endhint %}

5. After you click **Set identity**, as with any on-chain transaction, a popup window from your wallet of choice should appear, and it will ask you to sign the transaction. Sign the transaction and you are good to go.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** Some browsers might prevent popup windows, so make sure to click on the wallet extension icon if you see no popup.
{% endhint %}

6. After this, it usually takes approximately one day for the Ministry of Interior to confirm your on-chain identity and transfer your merits.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please wait patiently for the on-chain identity and transfer process to be completed, as it is a manual process at this time.
{% endhint %}
