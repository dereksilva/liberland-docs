# For Citizens and e-residents

##Onboarding
Migrating your identity from [liberland.org](www.liberland.org) to Liberland blockchain consists of a few steps:
1. Setting up a wallet
2. Securing keys
3. Getting merits and residency at liberland.org
4. Claiming merits and citizenship on chain

###1 - Setting up a wallet
A wallet address is your public address on the blockchain.
It comes with a seed phrase - 12 words that are the keys to your on-chain existence.
At this time, recommended wallets are subwallet or polkadotjs.
Set up a wallet and get your address.

###2 -  Securing keys
During the wallet setup phase, you got a 12 word mnemonic seed phrase. It is very important not to lose or share that phrase with anyone,
as it is the key or 'password' to your on-chain existence. Make sure to back it up and store it somewhere where it will not be lost.
Common low-tech solution is to write it on a piece of paper.

###3 - Getting merits and residency
Add your wallet address when editing profile on [liberland.org](https://liberland.org/en/update-profile)

Make sure your merits and residency/citizenship are in order in [liberland.org](www.liberland.org).

Make sure you have the correct amount is of merits. Make sure that residency and citizenship is correctly marked.
If you dont, ping whoever promised your merits or citizenship to get them.

It should look something like

###4 - Claim stuff on-chain

At this point, you should have your wallet address, your 12 word phrase safely stored, your wallet address, merits, and residency/citizenship saved at [liberland.org](www.liberland.org).

If on desktop, do the next steps using a browser you have polkadotjs or subwallet installed on.

If on mobile, use the Subwallet app and open the browser located in lower right corner in the app.

Navigate to [https://blockchain.liberland.org](https://blockchain.liberland.org)

Your wallet address should show on the screen. If it doesnt, make sure you have installed the wallet correctly or if on mobile, that you are using Subwallets browser

Next, click on Sign in. After signing up, you should be in!

Its time to claim your tokens and resident/citizen identity!

Open the menu and click on the 'profile' tab.

Since all actions on chain cost a small amount of gas fees and you are already a resident, you are eligible for a small amount to get you started.

First, click on the "Claim complimentary LLD" button. After a few seconds, it should tell you to refresh the page and you should have 2 LLDs,
its just so that you can start using the chain right away.

Next, click on Update identity, and set it to what you want your onchain identity to be. There is no requirement to use your real name if you dont want to,
but make sure to include your citizenship or residency status.

After you click on 'Set identity', as with any onchain transaction, a popup window from your wallet of choice should appear, and it will ask you to sign a transaction.
Some browsers might prevent popup windows, so make sure to click on the wallet extension icon if you see no popup. In any case, sign the transaction and you are good to go.

After this, it usually takes about a day for the Ministry of Interior to confirm your on-chain identity and transfer your merits.
