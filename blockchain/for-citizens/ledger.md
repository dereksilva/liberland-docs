- After the account is added, select 'Done'

- Refresh https://blockchain.liberland.org in your browser
- Select the wallet name, your selected Ledger wallet should appear in the list of available wallets
- Select your Ledger wallet from the list, continue using Liberland Blockchain Wallet normally

This will enable the ability to sign/confirmt transactions on any Substrate/Polkadot-based chain, including Liberland Blockchain, as long as the Polkadot app is open on your Ledger device.
