# Using Ledger

You should have an up to date ledger with a polkadot app installed on your ledger device.
You can install polkadot app on your ledger by going into "My ledger" in the Ledger live app
and searching for Polkadot in the app catalog and installing it. 
This will enable signing transactions on any substrate chain including Liberland as long as the polkadot
app is open on your ledger device.

Next, attach the ledger account to the browser extension you will use, for example subwallet.
You are now ready to use your Ledger on [blockchain.liberland.org](https://blockchain.liberland.org/liberland-login).

If you wish to migrate your previously existing account onto a ledger one, 
visit the [migration guide](./account-migration.md)
