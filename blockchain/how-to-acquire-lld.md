# How to Acquire LLD

There are multiple ways to acquire LLD. 
If you already have LLD on other chains like Ethereum or Solana, check out the [Bridging guide](./cross-chain-bridge.md).

The easiest way to get LLDs currently are to use one of the centralized exchanges where selling USDT for LLD is possible.

- [MEXC](https://www.mexc.com/exchange/LLD_USDT) on Liberland Blockchain
- [Coinstore](https://h5.coinstore.com/h5/signup?invitCode=IgwIq8) on Liberland Blockchain
- [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/tokens/ethereum/0x054c9d4c6f4ea4e14391addd1812106c97d05690?sellChain=1&sellAddress=0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7) on Ethereum blockchain
- [Emirex](https://emirex.com) on Liberland Blockchain
- [Raydium](https://raydium.io/swap/?inputMint=sol&outputMint=GwKKPsJdY5oWMJ8RReWLcvb82KzW6FKy2bKoYW7kHr16) on Solana

There are video tutorials showing you how to make a wallet, create an accounts on both centralized exchanges, withdraw LLD to your self-custodial wallet, and then nominate a validator.

In brief, the process is as follows:

- Create a wallet using [Subwallet](https://subwallet.app), [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz), Polkadotjs, or [Edge Wallet](https://edge.app)
  - Note: Edge Wallet does **not connect to applications** and is best used for cold storage of LLD
- Acquire LLD, withdraw them to your wallet
- Go to [Liberland Blockchain dApp](https://blockchain.liberland.org) 
- Go to Staking
- Choose a validator to nominate, and update your nominations

LLD purchased on other chains like Ethereum or Solana can be bridged to [Liberland Blockchain using HASHI Bridge](./cross-chain-bridge.md).
