# SOL liquidity pool Staking

Liberland offers LLD farm rewards for staking into SOL-LLD pool on raydium. 
This rewards holding LLD and strengthening the trading liquidity pool on decentralized exchanges such as Raydium.
The rewards for doing this are similar for staking the equivalent value on the Liberland blockchain itself which is currently
around 15-20% APY, but it dynamically reacts to staked amount, and LLD to SOL ratio.
The maximum inflation for the total supply is capped at 10% a year, with commitments to reduce it as time goes on.
In addition to LLD rewards, you also receive trading fees.
