# Liberland Press Kit

### Thanks for your interest in Liberland! 

Here's our press kit featuring the nation’s logo, flags, a collection of photos, and other information about our small, but intrepid nation.

## About Liberland

Liberland is built on classical liberal (libertarian) ideals which emphasize autonomy and minimize the state's encroachment on individual liberties. Rule of law, bodily autonomy, free trade, freedom of choice, freedom of movement, and others are all core tenets of our fledgling nation.

Liberland is a constitutional republic with elements of direct democracy that allows direct engagement of the citizens. The founder and head of state is President Vít Jedlička, and the state has two vice presidents and five ministers. The official language is English and the national currency is the Liberland merit.

**Liberland’s motto:** To Live and Let Live.

Liberland is building an open-source government that will maximize the freedom of its citizens. It was also the first nation to draft its constitution alongside its governance platform, the Liberland Blockchain.

## Settlement

Liberland has had a permanent settlement since early August 2023. At its height there were 20 settlers on-site, building basic infrastructure, homes, and community-focused amenities. Several settlers have remained throughout Winter 2023/2024, and we anticipate an even larger settlement will begin Spring 2024. This concludes our fulfillment of the Montevideo Convention on statehood.
