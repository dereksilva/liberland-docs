# Senate

## Overview

The Senate is the House of Lords of Liberland. We describe Liberland as a place where corporate governance meets Swiss democracy, and the Senate is the locus of the former: An august body of the citizens who have the most to lose should Liberland fail. This status will come into effect when our Blockchain-based government starts working in earnest and is not conditional on gaining complete control over the land.

## The Office of Senator

A Senator will first be interacting with the community using the Liberland governance platform, where they will learn to know the people of Liberland and establish their newly gained status. Later, the Senator might join us at the physical location of Liberland or remain a distant but active force, safeguarding the future and influencing the direction of Liberland. How they will make their senatorship work is all up to the Senators !

## Senator Share

The Senator votes in the Senate by the weight of their share. Liberland follows the principles of [meritocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meritocracy): where someone provides extraordinary help, they should receive a comparable degree of recognition.

## Constitutional Powers

Senate hard power is the mandate, granted by our [Constitution](https://github.com/liberland/Constitution/blob/master/Constitution.md) and confirmed by the blockchain, to execute the following actions:

1. cancel a referendum about any Laws before they gain legal force; if a Veto is cast, the bill will not gain legal force;
2. be the final authority in budgetary and spending matters, providing oversight on any outflows of money from the Liberland Treasury; the Senate can stop spending they find unjustified;
3. strike off the books any Regulation other than a Law even after it gains legal force; and
4. vote for the President of Liberland.

## Political influence

A Senator’s soft power is the influence and the prestige the office enjoys: without the contribution of the Senators, Liberland would not exist, at least not in its current form. Their word will have considerable value in the political landscape of Liberland. Senators may expect to be consulted on policymaking matters, as virtually no regulatory effort may come to fruition without their blessings. If they choose to give it, they may be sure that their opinion will matter and their expertise will be put to use for the better future of Liberland.

## Shares and Profits

As Senator, you receive LLM (Liberland Merits) for your time. The Merit is a cryptocurrency running on Liberland's blockchain. The currency is deflationary, somewhat similar to BTC (Bitcoin). The market cap is fixed at 70 millions. With your Merits, you also gain the right to a share in Liberland’s profits. You will be among the first to obtain your share when these dividends are distributed.

## Your Seat, Your Style

Conversely, some Senators may choose to stay back and observe, only giving advice or direction should they find things going really the wrong way. The choice is yours ! Senators will not be asked to hold any particular office and need not bear any responsibilities beyond their status as Senators; they are not government officials per se. Instead, they may live their private lives outside Liberland, engaging in whatever commercial and other pursuits they find significant. Their personal prosperity and growth are and remain their greatest service to Liberland. Being a Senator is all about making choices, and no two Senators will live out their office in the same way. They will be the elder statesmen, and the political system will listen to their words when they speak.
